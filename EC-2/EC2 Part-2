How to connect Instance With Putty and Terminal


first launch instanec------> in that instance create one key pair

based on that key pair we can able to connect the instance with putty and termina

every server/instance will have Public & Private IPs

Public IP------>used to access the application over the internet

Private IP------> used to access the application within the server

How to connect created instance with Putty/Terminal is steps under below

key pair has 2 types
1. .pem------>private enhancement
2. .ppk------->putty private key

in real time we mostly used .pem format only

putty will not support .pem file
putty will support only .ppk only to connect with putty
if we take .pem means we need to convert .pem to .ppk using putty gen 
if we take .ppk means we need to convert .ppk to .pem using putty gen 
both ways will work

PUTTYGEN used to convert the .pem file to .ppk file


PEM--------> we can able to connect with this .pem ---> mobaxtrem, command prompt, s code, terminal, git bash and jenkins
PPK--------> we can able to connect with this .ppk ---> only putty


select created instance Public IP----->open puttygen------->click Load-------> select all files to view created .pem file in local PC------> selct ---> ok--> save 
private key with our wish name----> over


now open putty-------->  copy and paste instance public IP on host name place in putty------>select SSH----> expand SSH-------> select AUTH ----> expand AUTH----->
select credentials-------> select  first option browse-----> select file -------> accept ok-----> ec2-user------> logged in succesfully

Authenticating with public key "imported-openssh-key"
